		<h1>The Rules of Online Air Hockey</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Welcome to the Melinda's Backups Online AirHockey System.  This system provides a mechanism for playing, over the 
			internet, a	simulation of air hockey.  The basic rules of the game are taken from the <a href="www.airhockey.com">United
			States Air Hockey Association</a> and adapted slightly for the limitations of on-line play</p>
			<p>The system comes in two parts.  The initial page where people can meet up, get a view of matches in progress and if
	they wish initiate a match, or go and play a single person practice game</p>
		<h2>The Opening Screen</h2>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>When you first arrive at the airhockey page, either directly or via the forum, or as a result of completing
			practice or a match, you will see two main areas below the page heading.  On the left is the list of matches underway,
or recently completed, to the right of this will be an area related the users currently involved with the air hockey system.  The
most important user is yourself, and it is here that you can select your current mode.  Below that is a list of players, with some
flags indicating their current mode</p>
			<p>You may desire to remain a spectator, in which case the screen will be automatically updated at approximately 15
second intervals with the current state of each match (updated everytime someone scores a goal), or the state of all the other
players.</p>
		<h3>The List of Matches</h3>
			<p>The list of matches shows the current progress of matches underway, together with the state of completed matches.
each match is shown its its own small area, with the names of the two players and their current score shown as a series of numbers
next to each name.  Initially, there is only one game with a 0-0 score, but as the match progresses each time a game reaches 7
points for one of the players, that game is over and a new game starts. Matches are the best of 7 games, so the first person to win
4 games wins the match.  You can tell whether a match is completed or not by whether there is a match duration shown or whether the
display gives the time that the match ended.</p>
			<p>Matches may be abandoned by one or other of the players (or because of a technical glitch) before the match is over.
 In this case the match will be should as completed before one or other player has 4 games.  These "Abandoned" games will only
remain in the list for about 10 minutes before they are removed.
		<h3>Your own state</h3>
			<p>There are four lines in your area indicating which state you are currently in, and allowing you to change state.  A
green tick indicates your current state.  When you first join this page you automatically start in spectator mode.  In this state,
you cannot be invited to play a match with someone else, you will just remain and watch the matches as they unfold.</p>
			<p>Although everyone else will see you in their list of players, the marker next to your name will be blank, meaning
you are only a spectatator</p>
			<p>If you wish to practice, click on the line that says
